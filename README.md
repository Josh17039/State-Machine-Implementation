# State-Machine-Implementation
The objective is to implement a finite state machine (FSM1), using the Moore machine format, where my student number is displayed on a seven segment display to a coressponding state machine sequence.

S0 => 1st Digit of student Number  
S8 => 9th Digit of student Number 
S6 => 7th Digit of student Number 
S4 => 5th Digit of student Number 
S2 => 3rd Digit of student Number 
S7 => 8th Digit of student Number 
S5 => 6th Digit of student Number 
S3 => 4th Digit of student Number 
S1 => 2nd Digit of student Number
